🌪️ NLP for Disaster Tweet Classification
Can AI save lives? This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify tweets as real disaster alerts or irrelevant content?
Built on BERT for bidirectional context understanding, the model helps emergency services filter signal from noise on social media in real time.

🚨 Problem Statement
In the early moments of a disaster, Twitter is often the first source of information—but it's cluttered with sarcasm, humor, and false alarms. Misclassifying these tweets can lead to:

>Panic due to false positives

>Missed responses to real disasters

>Spread of misinformation by news or public agencies

>This project aims to solve that by classifying tweets as either:

>✅ Real Disaster: "Massive earthquake hits Japan. 7.5 magnitude."

>❌ Not a Disaster: "My phone died… total disaster 😩"

🤖 Why BERT?
>📌 Handles negation & sarcasm effectively

>📌 Uses self-attention to consider word order and context

>📌 Processes tweets bidirectionally, unlike traditional models

>✅ Identifies phrases like “not a disaster” vs. “total disaster” with high precision

⚙️ How BERT Works (Simplified)
>Tokenization into subwords

>Special tokens like [CLS] and [SEP]

>Word & positional embeddings

>Self-attention over entire sequence

>Contextual sentiment/negation learning

>Final classification → Disaster or Not

🧰 Tech Stack
>Python, Pandas, Sklearn, PyTorch

>HuggingFace Transformers (BERT, DistilBERT)

>Jupyter Notebooks

>Dataset: 10,000 labeled tweets from Kaggle
